# Hi, Welcome to [Jishitha's Portfolio](https://ji54i74a.github.io/) ðŸ‘‹

This webpage will give a basic knowledge about myself.
I created this porfolio website for showcasing the works I have been recently doing.
You can found a small introductory part and list of projects that I worked for during
my course of MITxPRO fullstack development course.

For this website I chose a minimal design and for developing I mainly used HTML, CSS, 
Bootstrap [custom components](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/examples/) as a base starting and bootstrap grid classes for responsiveness.
Used few SVGs and added a little animations for interactivess!

## How to Run

This website is not created by using any advanded framework, for running this site 
do not require any specific installations. 

The index.html is the main landing page and other 3 pages can be navigated from this main page
- All projects are in **Portfolio page**, you can see the git repo codes of respective projects and 
live working demo as well.

  - The Pacman
  - Eyes Movement
  - Real time Bus Tracker
- A small introductory video and a breif description of me found in page **About**
- Contact informations like mail id, git user name, Linkedin and facebook links are listed in
**Contact** page

## Roadmap

This is the first version of my portfolio, I will be adding all my upcoming works to this site.
And later on I am planning to do upgrading the portfolio into efficient JavaSript framework like React or Angular.
